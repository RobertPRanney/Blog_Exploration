# Brain Storming For Bloging Project
### Robert Ranney
#### July 8th

After proposing 2 topics for potential projects to the teaching staff this one was suggested as a stronger better scoped project. Here is some further investigation.

Project: Blog Exploration

Description: Scrape a large number of blogs(possibly subset by a specific topic)

Analysis 1: Cluster the blogs by topic and see how the topics have changed over time, and see if new topics have emerged and see how the topics themselves have shifted over time. Hopefully achieve some good looking visualization

Analysis 2: Subset the blogs by topic - either an explicit topic or by by a clustered topic. Then try to see if I can find what makes it more successful as a blog. Will have to find a metric for traffic

Potential Problems: Biggest Issue by far will be if I can get the data. This is the first part.

* First Step: Choose a good blog option (blooger or wordpress most likely)

""" Rough Plan
    1) Use google searching and web scraping get names of blogs
        - Problem - limit to blogs:
            - Solution: use 'site:blogspot.com' in search
        - Problem - subset to category
            - Solution: ummm use 'category in search'
        -Problem

    2) Use blogger api to get the posts from a given blog
