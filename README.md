# Blog_Exploration

A project to look closer at what makes a succesfful blog.

Not much work done yet. Still in the data collection phase.

Things to accomplish soon
* Pick a decent subtopic that is interesting, yet still receives lots of traffic, as much as I would like to do 'Data Science' as a topic, I don't think it has as much internet traffic as I would like. Might have to pick something like 'cooking' or some garbage to truly get a feel for a 'successful blog'.
* Write a google scraper, currently I am doing this by hand, but that is not super efficient. I can pull about a thousand links in 5 minutes right now, but that doesn't make the project nearly as reproducilble. Even that way though google still throws up capchta pages due to the repetitive nature of it. Current thought is to make a selenium scraper that takes weird random sleeps, and places differing randomly generated queries in between.
* Find a way around 'google limit problem', it seems that every search only returns the same number of results, 'site:blogspot.com "data science" 2005 returns 750~ ish results, but so does 'dog', maybe another way for google to limit scraping
* blog and post collection currenly works for blogger, need to get similar functions working for word press.

Goal: Finish data collection functionally by end 7/19
